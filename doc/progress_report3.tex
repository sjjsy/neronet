\section{Introduction} \bgset{gfx/neural1__bgmod.jpg}
\begin{frame}{Introduction}{Goals} % Joona
  Our goal is to develop a tool for computational researchers to enable easy
  \begin{itemize}
  \item specification and management of experiment queues
  \item batch submission of experiment jobs to computing clusters
  \item monitoring of ongoing experiments' logs and parameter values
  \item access to experiment information during and after the run
  \item configurable notifications on experiment state and progress
  \item configurable criteria for experiment autotermination
  \item logging of experiment history
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Introduction}{What} % Samuel
  In essence the product is a Python-based tool that enables computational researchers to conduct their research more effectively.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item It utilizes SSH and TCP sockets to distribute the computational workload into computer clusters. It supports the Slurm job and resource manager but can function without it as well.
  \item It is framework agnostic in that it permits the use of a very wide variety of tools to actually conduct the computing.
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Results}{Sprint 0} \bgset{gfx/neural3__bgmod.jpg}
  Goal: \emph{Team building and preparing for sprint 1} \Done{}

  Product Backlog Items: \emph{None}

  Sprint 0 took a lot of effort from us since the project topic was very challenging to dive into. Also none of us had done this course before. Interviews with Jelena \& Simo helped us to understand the project.
  
  We were proud of our efforts in the sprint.
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Results}{Sprint 1}
  Goal: \emph{Develop a prototype that offers the most basic functionality via a CLI}
  
  Product Backlog Items: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item US1: As a user, I want a basic user guide that would cover the installation of Neronet and its use via CLI. \Done{}
  \item US2: As a user, I want to specify clusters by address and type to specify my computing resources. \Done{}
  \item US3: As a user, I want to specify experiments by name, files and parameters. \Done{}
  \item US4: As a user, I want to submit experiments to unmanaged nodes. \Done{}
  \item US5: As a user, I want an experiment status report so that I can review experiment status details. \Done{}
  \end{itemize}

  Just a prototype, not ready for release to users.
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Results}{Sprint 2}
  Goal: \emph{Develop a stable version for end user testing}
  
  \pause Product Backlog Items: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item US6: as a user, I want to set preferences (name, email, default cluster) \Done{}
  \item US7: As a user, I want my experiment config attributes to support generation of value combinations \Done{}
  \item US8: As a user, I want my experiment specifications to be able to inherit properties \Done{}
  \item US9: As a user, I want to see a basic status report in the gui \Done{}
  \item US10: Aas a user, I want the program to enable easy setup. \Done{}
  \end{itemize}
  
  \pause Stable but very limited functionality. % Only synchronous
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Results}{Sprint 3}
  Goal: \emph{Finish asynchronous system functionality and create a GUI mockup}
  
  \pause Product Backlog Items: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item US11: As a user, I want to save important information about my clusters \Done{}
  \item US12: As a user, I want to group my clusters \Done{}

  \item US14: As a user, I want configurable criteria for experiment warnings and autotermination \Done{}
  \item US15:: As a user, I want a status report so that I can get an overview \Done{}
  \end{itemize}

  \pause Rewriting, refactoring and development under the hood. % In this
  % sprint we also finished asynchronous daemon system so users could submit
  % and manage multiple experiments and clusters, created gui and made our
  % software to support python 2.7 and newer versions (previously only python
  % 3.5)
\end{frame}

  \item US19: As a maintainer, I want a clear maintenance guide \Done{}
  \item US20:: As a user, I want to have a helpful web community to help me out \Done{}
  \end{itemize}
  
  \pause Improving user experience; set up a continuous integration system
  % In this sprint we started to use automated tests using travis CI and got
  % input from user testing. 
\end{frame}

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Results}{User testing}
We reached out to Triton admin and he gave us great feedback.
\begin{itemize}
      \pause \item Synchronizing files between clusters and client computers:
      \begin{itemize}
          \item Our system so far has used rsync and it has exceeding
              amounts of I/O operations when used with large experiments.
          \item We should use scp as to reduce disk operations.
          \item Home directory cannot be used in some clusters, we need to have an option to choose working directory.
      \end{itemize}
      \pause \item In general he liked our usability.
\end{itemize}
\pause Our PO gave us some input regarding usability after his initial testing.
\begin{itemize}
    \pause \item Test connection when specifying clusters to assure the ssh address is valid. FIXED
    \item Error and success messages should be more specific.
    \item Some bugs were also found and fixed.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\section{Demo}
\begin{frame}{Demo}
  (Live demonstration of the current release.)
  %We have created video demo and would like to show it now.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Installation
  \item Cluster \& experiment configuration
  \item Status review
  \item Experiment submission
  \item Viewing updates
  \item Viewing plots
  \item GUI
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
\section{Quality} \bgset{gfx/neural1__bgmod.jpg}
\begin{frame}{Quality}
  Definition of done:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We defined \Done{} in three levels: BI, sprint and project
  \item BI level: Unit tests are written where applicable, Code confroms to guidelines (PEP8), Code is commented and documented, Independent peer review has been completed
  \item Sprint level: All BIs in the sprint backlog are \emph{Done}, Reasonable automated tests written, Comprehensive system tests are conducted, reported and reviewed, Sprint goal is achieved
  \pause \item Updates to DoD:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item All updates to DoD at the end of each sprint are written in the retrospectives section
    \end{itemize}
  \item We have mainly followed our DoD as planned, but in sprint 3 we didn't yet have automated tests so we replaced that with manual user testing. Documentation of system testing could also be better.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Quality}
  Used QA practices and tools:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Commenting \& documentation -- forces to rethink from another
    perspective, facilitates peer review
  \item Python standard unittest framework -- white-box test automation
  \item Travis CI runs unit tests automatically after every push
  \item Functional testing -- manual black-box testing based on specs
  \item Peer review -- quality assurance
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Quality}
  Relevant quality attributes:
  \begin{itemize}
  \pause \item \alert{Usability} -- We have put a lot of effort in creating a helpful user manual, start guide and example use cases to help newbies better understand our product. Some error and success messages could be more helpful though, but we will make them better right at the start of the next sprint.
  \pause \item \alert{Reliability} -- Our software's reliability should be good at this point. Tests haven't shown many unexpected crashes.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Quality}
  Relevant quality attributes:
  \begin{itemize}
  \pause \item \alert{Extendability} -- We have paid attention to making our software easily extendable from the start, and in the last sprint we put effort in creating a maintenance guide so it's easier to extend our software even without having been in the development team.
  \pause \item \alert{Performance} -- We found out at the end of this sprint that our software using rsync might cause too much I/O operations in some cases. We will replace that with scp and after that our software's performance should be pretty good.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

  \end{table}
  \pause \begin{itemize}
  \item Our team had comparatively little experience
  \item The project's problem domain was challenging to understand
  \item Studying existing products and technologies took a lot of time
  \item At the beginning scrum master served also as team leader and lead developer
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\section{Retros} \bgset{gfx/neural3__bgmod.jpg}
\begin{frame}{Retros: Sprint 0}
  Sprint planning:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item BI clarity and simplicity (user guide helps)
  \item It might have been better if the PO had created the stories from scratch -Matias, Tuomo
  \item We should actively seek more input from PO when developing the user guide
  \item we should make sure we reserve enough time for the actual story selection on Monday -Matias
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Retros: Sprint 0}
  Daily scrums:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We have mostly been doing teamwork, so there has been little new info in the scrums -Matias -Joona -Teemu
  \item They have been overly long and they have extended due to inexperience.
  \item People are late.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Retros: Sprint 0}
  Teamwork sessions:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Sessions are too long and sometimes people get hungry
  \item Generally someone has to leave early or comes late
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Retros: Sprint 0}
  Tools:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Flowdock is good x6
  \item Agilefant has a steep learning curve. -Iiro
  \item People tend to forget to log their time at agilefant
  \item Github hasn't been used much. Hope to use it more during future sprints
  \item Floobits is very buggy.
  \item Top 3 tools: 1) GitHub 2) Flowdock 3) Agilefant
  \item Worst 3 tools: 1) Floobits 2) Six tactics 3) Agilefant
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Retros: Sprint 0}
  How teamwork could be improved:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item People should be more on time
  \item Scrum Master shouldn't have to work as a team leader too.
  \item Hard to think of improvements since we haven't really started coding yet
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Retros: Sprint 1}
  Improvements since sprint 0:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Replaced six tactics with Team spirit recap
  \item Balanced our team's power structure by selecting a team leader for each sprint.
  \item Punctuality: Many have improved, Iiro hasn't. Samuel has also been more absent. Everybody should try to be more punctual or at least inform early about being late.
  \item Ambiguity in user stories got less of an issue due to the user guide
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Retros: Sprint 1}
  Evaluating practises:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Team leader per sprint:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Matias: Great not to give Samuel all responsibility
        \item Iiro: Might be a bit confusing for the PO and I'm not sure how I'll manage it in the next sprint
        \item Tuomo, Teemu, Joona and Samuel like the idea
      \end{itemize}
  
  \item Pair programming
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Matias: Works fine, a lot of time used for coordination within the pair
        \item Iiro: I feel that our pair work might have been a bit inefficient in development and testing, but it helped a lot in planning and documentation
        \item Teemu: Difficult to share work. Otherwise works well.
        \item Samuel: In sprint 2 I suggest we program in pairs but do not employ pair programming, work together as they best see fit.
      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Retros: Sprint 1}
  Evaluating practises:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Developing user guide first:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Matias: We shall see
        \item Iiro: I feel we have strayed from the reason we began to implement a user guide. Now it feels to be restrictive rather than descriptive.
        \item Joona: I feel that it is very good as it reflects the requirements of the PO.
        \item Samuel: It should be considered as a sort of prototype. It is not useful to hang ourselves to it.
      \end{itemize}
  \item Sprint planning
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Matias: Difficult to break user stories into useful and small tasks
        \item Iiro: Our stories were already small, they were difficult to break even smaller.
        \item There was slight contradictions in understanding user stories
        \item Integration work took a lot more time than expected
      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Retros: Sprint 1}
  Evaluating practises:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Daily Scrums:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Matias: Worked fine this time, not of much use
        \item Iiro: Need to attend more of them...
        \item Teemu: They could have been used more in integration and inter pair coordination
      \end{itemize}
  \item Teamwork sessions:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Matias: times fine, people are away too often, peer reviews should be distributed evenly throughout the sprint
        \item Iiro: Sometimes too much commotion
      \end{itemize}
  \item Peer review:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Done in a big hurry, we should reserve more time for it
        \item We should study more about how it should be done
      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Retros: Sprint 1}
  Evaluating tools:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item flowdock:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Matias: Hasn't used much
        \item Iiro: doesn't like the idea of PO reading the messages
      \end{itemize}
  \item Whatsapp:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Matias: reads often
        \item Iiro: I don't keep my phones internet always on so it hasn't been optimal
      \end{itemize}
  \item Agilefant:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Matias: No complaints
        \item Iiro: Still feels bit rigid
      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Retros: Sprint 1}
Evaluating tools:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Google calendar:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Matias: works fine
        \item Iiro: Haven't used it much after we scheduled regular times
      \end{itemize}
  \item Github:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Matias: works fine
        \item Iiro: The usage still needs some working. There are some files that shouldn't have been pushed to the remote
      \end{itemize}
  \item Floobits:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Matias: Hasn't used much
        \item Iiro: Good for meetings
      \end{itemize}
