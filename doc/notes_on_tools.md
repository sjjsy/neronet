Organized by tool domain.

## Software testing

[Robot Framework] is a generic test automation framework for acceptance
testing and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). It has easy-to-use
tabular test data syntax and it utilizes the keyword-driven testing approach.
Its testing capabilities can be extended by test libraries implemented either
with Python or Java, and users can create new higher-level keywords from
existing ones using the same syntax that is used for creating test cases.
