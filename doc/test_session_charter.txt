1. What - tested areas

GUI and CLI:
- Installation
- Experiment specification, submitting, result fetching.
- Cluster specification
- 

2. Why - goal and focus

The first purpose of our testing is to see if a technically proficient user
 is able to start using our program with the help of the current start guide,
 without needing any other guidance. Another potential benefit of the testing
is discovering potential errors in important functions such as cluster specification, 
experiment specification and experiment submitting.

In addition to testing Neronet using the CLI, we will also test the GUI to confirm that 
it can also be used to perform the most important functions.

3. How - approach

For the testing session we will meet at Maarintalo, in the class 240/241. To test Neronet,
we will use a UNIX system which can be a personal laptop or simply a public access Maari computer.
We will set up a virtualenv so that the installation doesn't conflict with other Python packages
on the computer. After this we instruct the testers to try and install and use Neronet as a normal
user would.

Testing data to be used is simply the example experiments we have prepared.
