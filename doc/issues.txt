Todo:

- iss010 Error handling when defining or submitting to invalid clusters.
- iss012 Think about what is interesting enough to take space in the GUI
- iss013 Fetch should happen automatically when changes are made
- iss014 Submit and other core buttons/stuff should be highlighted
- iss015 More feedback from the CLI and GUI (when deleting is successful etc, experiment succesfully defined)
- iss016 Submit could also define the experiment given a experiment folder
- iss017 Sending multiple experiments via cli
- iss018 Nerocli should print help commands given no other parameters
- iss019 Cluster help is inadequate
- iss020 Status label to GUI
- iss021 Handling status reports after the size of the table increases (so that the status report isnt 100+ lines)
- iss022 Submitting an experiment multiple times causes stdlog to do something
- iss023 Gui change highlight color
- iss024 Gui accepts empty fields
- iss025 Gui move errors to gui
- iss026 Hide experiments by rightclicking label
- iss027 Hide params by right clicking labels
- iss028 Highlight all if name is clicked, else cell
- iss029 Experiment file must be on the experiment folder
- iss030 Better distinction between fixed parameters and user defined parameters
- iss031 Experiment command is confusing maybe "add experiment instead" also for clusters
- iss032 Load explanation
- iss033 Making a cluster with a same name
- iss034 Better explanation what experiment id is (same for clusters) perhaps exp name instead
- iss035 Where to see that data after fetching
- iss036 Running nerocli wihtout parameters produces no results

Done:

- iss011 Color coding bug
- iss023 GUI change highlight color
- iss024 GUI accepts empty fields
- iss025 GUI move errors to GUI
- iss020 Status label to GUI
- iss028 Highlight all if name is clicked, else cell
