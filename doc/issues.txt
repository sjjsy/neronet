Todo:

- iss010 Error handling when defining or submitting to invalid clusters.
- iss011 Color coding bug
- iss012 Think about what is interesting enough to take space in the GUI
- iss013 Fetch should happen automatically when changes are made
- iss014 Submit and other core buttons/stuff should be highlighted
- iss015 More feedback from the CLI and GUI (when deleting is successful etc, experiment succesfully defined)
- iss016 submit could also define the experiment given a experiment folder
- iss017 sending multiple experiments via cli
- iss018 nerocli should print help commands given no other parameters
- iss019 cluster help is inadequate
- iss020 status label to GUI
- iss021 handling status reports after the size of the table increases (so that the status report isnt 100+ lines)
- iss022 submitting an experiment multiple times causes stdlog to do something
- iss023 gui change highlight color
- iss024 gui accepts empty fields
- iss025 gui move errors to gui
- iss026 hide experiments by rightclicking label
- iss027 hide params by right clicking labels
- iss028 highlight all if name is clicked, else cell
- iss029 experiment file must be on the experiment folder
- iss030 better distinction between fixed parameters and user defined parameters
- iss031 experiment command is confusing maybe "add experiment instead" also for clusters
- iss032 load explanation
- iss033 making a cluster with a same name
- iss034 better explanation what experiment id is (same for clusters) perhaps exp name instead
- iss035 where to see that data after fetching

Done:
