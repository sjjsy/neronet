## Introduction

Deep learning is one of the newest trends in machine learning.
Instead of specifying features that a machine should learn, neural networks
can learn these features from data.
Recent breakthroughs of deep learning include state-of-the-art image
[classification algorithms](http://www.technologyreview.com/news/537436/baidus-artificial-intelligence-supercomputer-beats-google-at-image-recognition/),
computers
[playing Atari-games above human-level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1eYniJ0Rnk)
and flexible tools for
[analyzing natural language](http://www.wired.com/2015/06/ais-next-frontier-machines-understand-language/).
Training of neural networks is often challenging, with many practical
difficulties:

- how do we know what is happening inside a neural network?
- Where is the network making errors?
- How is the training of the network proceeding?
- How do we manage a queue of different experiments?
- Why is training the network too slow?

## State of the art

Deep learning research is conducted by modelling neural networks and other
constructs using specific deep learning libraries. Such libraries include:

- [Theano] -- A Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate
  mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently.
    - [Lasagne] -- A lightweight library to build and train neural networks
      in Theano.
    - [Pylearn2] -- A machine learning library built on top of Theano.
    - [Blocks] -- A framework to facilitate building and managing neural
      network models using Theano.
      See [examples](https://github.com/mila-udem/blocks-examples).
- [Torch] -- A scientific computing framework with wide support for machine
  learning algorithms.
  See [tutorial](http://torch5.sourceforge.net/manual/newbieTutorial.html).
- There are lots of software for deep learning: [Deep learning portal]

Deep learning research involves a lot of computing which is why the deep
learning researchers at Aalto currently utilize a few different methods to
meet their computational needs:

- BYOM -- *Bring your own machine* is the first way to test simple
  computations. However, the lack of computing power and preinstalled and
  configured tools as well as interference with other tasks required of
  the machine make this method an inpopular one.
- gpus -- A group of servers with powerful GPUs maintained by Aalto CS
  Department (Simo Tuomisto, 3rd floor).
  These servers named `gpu[1-n]` are accessible by SSH by anyone with an
  Aalto CS account. The department's sysadmins maintain the machines and
  install generally useful software on request.
  Researchers use `virtualenv` to manage their own libraries.
  Certain user directories that are automounted in Aalto work desktops are
  also mounted on these servers which facilitates file management.
- [Triton] -- A computer cluster managed by Aalto for
  use by all Aalto researchers.
  It utilizes the [Slurm] queuing and task management system
  to distribute computing resources to researchers. In practice, researchers
  access a gateway server using SSH and then add their scripts to the queue
  with terminal commands (eg. `srun OPTIONS FILES`). A nasty aspect for
  deep learning researchers is that they might have little knowledge of when
  and how their experiments are progressing and few means to interact with
  them. Similar to the case with `gpu` some user directories are also
  available here.
- [CSC] -- Another cluster managed by the Finnish IT center for science.
  From Aalto researchers' point of view, it is basically similar to `triton`
  but harder to access and with no filesystem shares.
- Amazon -- A commercial choice for cloud computation. When Pyry was doing
  research at Amazon he realized their systems were not fancier than those
  at the Aalto CS Department. One could hire servers, start an SSH session in
  one and start coding.

In addition to advanced cluster computing environments and schedulers such as
[Slurm] or [OGE] or even [Jobman] (another tool to facilitate launching
concurrent experiments) researchers use simpler job scheduler and experiment
manager tools created or under development in deep learning labs around the
world, often in the midst of other neural networks libraries and tools.
However, many of them are somewhat hackish solutions to serve immediate needs.
A better dedicated tool could be built to replace them. Examples:

- [LadderNet] --  Ladder network is a deep learning algorithm that combines
  supervised and unsupervised learning but is extended with some experiment
  manager type software
- [sacred] -- Sacred is a tool to configure, organize, log and reproduce
  computational experiments. It is designed to introduce only minimal
  overhead, while encouraging modularity and configurability of experiments.
  See the [docs](http://sacred.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
- [soteloplot] -- A script that sends email with plots

## Project goals

A good toolbox for deep learning would let a researcher easily specify
experiments, manage a queue of experiments, and automatically monitor networks
during training. During train-time, a diagnostics toolbox can perform various
analyses on the training log and network parameters to detect possible
problems early on. Notifications can be sent to a researcher so that expensive
computing time is not wasted on an experiment that is unlikely to give good
results. Naturally, the tool should not create a huge computational overhead,
and usability should be good.
Majority of the work involves creating a tool that helps a user define network
inputs, manage an experiment queue, and visualize intermediary and final
values of the network.
The final product will be a tool for training neural networks that should be
agnostic of the deep learning framework (e.g. frameworks *Torch* or *Theano*
could both be used), and can benefit any neural networks researchers.
Requirement gathering could be done from various deep learning users at the
university, and potentially students could talk to some researchers abroad as
well.

It is also important to be able to monitor host resources (GPU memory,
RAM, disk-space). Ideally it should check already before starting whether
there is enough diskspace available. Also consider profiling (python, theano,
etc).

In addition to the above, these requirements have been explicitly mentioned
by deep learning researchers:

- Sends customizable email notification (validation/test results, training
  curve/crash report)
- Queue and schedule lots of experiments with slightly different settings to
  a cluster or just your local network
- Should be lightweight (depend only on the python standard lib)
- Easy resume capability (load parameters and hyperparameters from disk and
  continue after a crash/failure)
- Autocheck the code repo's git version and other facts
- Record the history of "variables of interest" into a json file (validation
  costs & validation error rates after each epoch)
- The experiment manager should as simple as possible
    - Should not rely on one toolchain
    - Jobman feels oppressive. NoSQL setup should work better
- Command line is king; programmatic access from Python is nice to have

## Tools and technology

The toolbox could be written e.g. as an interactive web tool (e.g. with
JavaScript) that could be always run on a server that manages the experiments.

## Requirements for the students

The toolbox could be implemented for instance as a hybrid of JavaScript and
Python. Some other language can be also considered if it appears more suitable
for the task. Students participating in this project will need to be willing
to read a little bit about neural networks, but a detailed view is not
required. The interface of the tool should be created in English.

## Legal Issues

Potentially, the resulting code could be released under an open-source license
after the project. Signing the non-disclosure agreement (NDA) included in the
Aalto's contract template is not required.

## Client

Aalto Universityâ€™s Deep learning and Bayesian modeling group conducts research
in the field of neural networks. Recent projects include for instance
*DeepBeat* a neural network that
[generates rap](http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/05/22/this-rappers-a-machine/),
an image-processing framework network *Ladder* that
[learns to recognize images](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.02672.pdf)
from very small training datasets, and an ongoing project of financial
predictions.

The toolbox would ideally be used by all researchers at Aalto and also
researchers at other universities and companies. The student will have a
good opportunity to get to know the field of machine learning and deep
learning during the project.

### Triton Networking

The cluster has two internal networks: Infiniband for MPI and Lustre
filesystem and Gigabit Ethernet for everything else like NFS for /home
directories and ssh.

The internal networks are unaccessible from outside. The only host available
for user access is the front-end triton.aalto.fi.

All compute nodes and front-end are connected to DDN SFA10k storage system:
large disk arrays with the Lustre filesystem on top of it cross-mounted under
/triton directory. The system provides about 430TB of disk space available to
end-user.

### Usage

## Existing tools

### SLURM

- [Slurm] at llnl.gov
- Wikipedia: [Slurm Workload Manager]

Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) is an open source,
fault-tolerant, and highly scalable cluster management and job scheduling
system for large and small Linux clusters.

[Slurm Workload Manager]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurm_Workload_Manager

#### Usage

- [Interactive use](https://rc.fas.harvard.edu/resources/running-jobs/#Interactive_jobs_and_srun)
- [Summary of CLI usage](http://slurm.schedmd.com/pdfs/summary.pdf)

Notes

- salloc obtain job allocation
- srun obtain a job allocation and execute an app
- sbatch [options] script [args...]
- sbatch submits a batch script to SLURM. By default redirects output to
  "slurm-%j.out" ("%j" is the job allocation number).

Example

```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -J LM_miuc            # Specify job name
#SBATCH -o miuc_%j.out        # Specify output file name
#SBATCH -p gpu                # Request a specific partition for the resource allocation
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:2          # Generic resources required by each node
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=16000   # Memory required per allocated CPU.
#SBATCH -t 1-23:59:59         # Time limit

module load python-env
cd ../owlet
echo "Starting the run"

# launch experiment
python lang_experiment.py
```

#### Technical overview

As a cluster resource manager, Slurm has three key functions:

- Allocates exclusive and/or non-exclusive access to resources (compute nodes)
  to users for some duration of time so they can perform work
- Provides a framework for starting, executing, and monitoring work (normally
  a parallel job) on the set of allocated nodes
- Arbitrates contention for resources by managing a queue of pending work.

#### Co-workability

- Our app could be a simple command line tool that would be installed to all
  the hosts where experiments are done
- The `SBATCH` script (or the python program launched by it) could utilize
  our tool to provide progress information (text, values, files) to a central
  server that we would also develop which would then provide the information
  to the researchers.

Example

```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -J LM_miuc            # Specify job name
#SBATCH -o %j.out             # Specify output file name
module load python-env
# Send initial start notice along with system environment information
neronet --server neronet.cs.hut.fi --started exp01.py
# Launch the experiment
python exp01.py --iter=0-500
# Send progress information along with log and data files
neronet --server neronet.cs.hut.fi --progress exp01.py --log *.out --data *.json
# Continue experiment
python lang_experiment.py --iter=500-1000
# Send end state information along with log and data files
neronet --server neronet.cs.hut.fi --finished exp01.py --log *.out --data *.json
```

### Oracle Grid Engine

[OGE] (previously known as SGE, Sun Grid Engine) is a grid computing computer
cluster software system similar to Slurm. It manages grid computing resources
and accepting, scheduling, dispatching, and managing the execution of large
numbers of standalone, parallel or interactive user jobs.

A practical tutorial is available
[online](http://bioinformatics.mdc-berlin.de/intro2UnixandSGE/sun_grid_engine_for_beginners/README.html).

Example

```
# Submit a job
qsub -V -b n -cwd runJob.sh
```

### Jobman

[Jobman] aims to facilitate the process of launching many concurrent jobs, by
automatically handling how parameters are passed to your programs and how
results are stored for further analysis. While Jobman is application-agnostic,
it is particularly well suited for machine learning when performing model
selection (handling of hyperparameters, storing and analyzing results).

Notes

- requires python 2.7 to work on client side
- requires postgreSQL on server side
- client(s) running connects to server to retrieve a job to execute
- jobman does it's thing and outputs files that an be synced with rsync
- jobman updates database that job has been completed

### Testing

[Robot Framework] is a generic test automation framework for acceptance
testing and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). It has easy-to-use
tabular test data syntax and it utilizes the keyword-driven testing approach.
Its testing capabilities can be extended by test libraries implemented either
with Python or Java, and users can create new higher-level keywords from
existing ones using the same syntax that is used for creating test cases.

## Meeting notes

### First meeting with PO

Written by Joona \& Teemu

Questions we discussed

- importance of queue management functions
- technical details

Things we clarified

- requirements by the PO
- the current workflow

Decisions made

- Command prompt applications, no web UI
- Two different applications: Server and client
- Client application contacts server. The client application doesn't have to be running all the time.
- Server application contacts the clusters to run the experiments, manages the experiment queues and collects information on running experiments. The server also saves the information and notifies the client if the experiments go wrong. In an ideal situation the server application is always running.
- Queue management can use either jobman or slurm 
- Server makes a .csv document about the past experiments and their outputs and the client can download it.
- Server can tell the information on the available GPU:s etc.
- Config:
- Defines the ID of the experiment (author, subject, name, group name, git commit ID)
- Define the variables that must be extracted and sent to the server
- The Preconditions (minimum available disk space, expected max time, minimum RAM)
- The files that must be sent to the cluster

Things yet to research/decide

- Simo
- Possibly in the future a web interface and user login

Roadmap

- TBD
