# Scrum

Scrum is a framework for developing complex products. It was created in order
to improve productivity, creativity and reactivity in solving complex problems
iteratively and incrementally while optimizing predictability and controlling
risks.

Its philosophy is rooted on three core pillars: *transparency*, *inspection*,
and *adaptation*. Transparency is vital for communication and a prerequisite
for effective inspection. Learning by careful inspection in turn is a
prerequisite for productive adaptation. Adaptation is how the system improves
itself in order to employ its resources more productively.
