to develop a toolbox for deep learning research with the following features:
- framework agnostic, support for at least Torch and Theano
- easy specification and management of experiments and experiment queues
- the work from the experiment queues is distributed to a computer cluster
- easy access to training logs during and after training
- automatic monitoring of training logs, configurable notifications of progress and state changes
- configurable criteria for experiment autotermination
- low computational and memory overhead
- good usability
- easily maintainable and extensible
- open source
