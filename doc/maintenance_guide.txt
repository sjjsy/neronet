Steps to take to upload your current version of Neronet to PyPI:
1. Create a PyPI account:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=register_form

2. Write a ~/.pypirc file to hold your PyPI credentials
#Example:
[distutils]
index-servers=pypi

[pypi]
repository = https://pypi.python.org/pypi
username = <username>
password = <password>

3. Ask current PyPI neronet package owner for maintenance permissions
Currently it's blomqvt1, or Teemu Blomqvist

4. Update metadata in setup.py. At the very least you need to increase
the version number.

5. In the repo, use 'python setup.py sdist' to create a source distribution
of the neronet package.

6. Then use 'python setup.py sdist upload' to upload to PyPI.
