            Because <em>communication is key</em> in order to successfully
            deliver results in the software industry, we've chosen this
            rather liberal, humane and straightforward approach to presenting
            ourselves:

            The seven young men pictured above are going to ensure that they

            Necessarily thus, we will also make sure that our project owner,
            you <small>(potentially)</small>, end up more than satisfied of both the overall
            experience you will have working with us and the end product we
            will deliver you.

            our team up, organized and going happily full speed towards our

                  <h2>Samuel Marisa <small>– the scrum master</small></h2>
                  <p>
                    Samuel is an Industrial Engineering and Management student
                    backed with teenage years spent optimizing algorithms
                    in C++, programming Java games, and playing with 3D
                    engines.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    His work experience includes developing Django based
                    algorithm evaluation services, multi-user Ruby on
                    Rails applications, and being thrice the head assistant
                    of Aalto data structures and algorithms courses.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Last semester he really enjoyed the multi-stakeholder
                    courses
                      <em>Web Software Development (5 cr)</em> and
                      <em>Operations Management Project (5 cr)</em>
                    both of which included major teamwork components.
                    He received the grades 5 and 4 from them respectively.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He values straightforward communication, adherence to
                    agreed practices, and minimalism in programming.
                    He wants effective teamplay and hates unambiguity and
                    disorganization.

                    This guy is an open source, computing and technology
                    enthusiast. Has been diagnosed as such since childhood.
                    After having been exposed to a major dose of CS related
                    phenomena in his youth he subconsequently ended up for
                    treatment in the IEM department of Aalto School of Science.
                    He is still receiving his medication, but the condition has
                    only gotten worse.

            Even if the technoloy you want us to apply does not show up in
            either table there's no reason to worry. We'll be happy to learn
            why you value the technology and learn to apply it. We're sure
            we will benefit from learning almost any new technology.

            We want to apply the Scrum methodology but are also interested in
            Kanban and other lightweight methodologies for continuous
            improvement. We aim to learn professional software development
            practices and to apply them effectively.
