            Because <em>communication is key</em> in
            delivering results in the software industry, we've chosen this
            rather liberal, humane and straightforward approach to presenting
            ourselves:

          <h1>Mr/Ms Product Owner,</h1>
          <img src="photos/team.jpg" alt="A photo of the whole team">
          <p>
            We are pleased to meet you!
            The seven young men pictured above are going to ensure that they
            receive a satisfactory grade from the course (4-5).
            Necessarily thus, we will also make sure that our project owner,
            you <small>(potentially)</small>, end up more than satisfied of both the overall
            experience you will have working with us and the end product we
            will deliver you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Below, we explain our project related
            <a href="#interests">interests</a>
            and
            <a href="#requirements">requirements</a>,
            briefly describe key information about each team member and the

          </p>
          <h1 id="interests">Interests</h1>
          <p>
            Here is a list of the projects we found interesting along with
            some explanation.
          </p>
          <h3>#2: Toolbox for managing the training neural networks / Aalto</h3>
          <p>
            We found the subject very interesting.
            We are all interested in neural networks and AI.
            It also seems like the product owner has a clear understanding of
            what they want which makes our work very straightforward, thus
            making it easier for us to achieve our goals in the course.
            The mentioned technologies and other choices (open source licence)
            are also very much embedded within our existing knowhow and
            preferences.
            This is currently the project we most hope to undertake.
          </p>
          <h3>
            #15: Modeling and mining the state of the Internet for improved
            understanding of safe and unsafe domains / F-Secure
          </h3>
          <p>
            This project's subject is also very interesting.
            We see data mining and cyber security playing an increasingly
            important role in the future.
            We would love to learn more about the topics and related tools
            (f. ex. Spark) in practice.
            Also, F-Secure has an attractive reputation as a company.
          </p>
          <h3>#32: RELEX Graphical Dashboards / RELEX</h3>
          <p>
            It was our scrum master who attracted our interest into this
            project and the company.
            The fact that last years course Quality Award was handed over
            to the team that undertook their project proves the POs
            suitability for the course.
            Although the subject is not thrilling, we find it very motivating
            to work for a fast developing company on something that is likely
            to yield real value in the industry.
          </p>
          <h3>#11: Super Entertainment System for offices / Avoin.Systems</h3>
          <p>
            This project is set apart from others by its very
            loosely defined objectives. Normally, this would be a negative,
            but it seems that the PO is willing and able to give much support
            to the team in the requirements engineering as well as
            later phases. The freedom to build the product over our own
            interests and skills with expert support is compelling.
          </p>
          <h3>
            #7: Transportation network apps / Aalto
          </h3>
          <p>
            We feel that developing software related to
            classical transportation network problems is likely to be
            very straightforward and bear little risk.
            Consequently leaving us more mental power to ensuring high quality
            in the development process and beauty and smarts in our solutions.
          </p>
          <h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>
          <p>
	          We hope/expect the following from our PO:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Commitment in the project. We hope you are motivated and
              invested in!
            </li>
            <li>
              Adequate support and collaboration when necessary (RE, testing, <strong>feedback</strong>,
              deployment to production).
            </li>
            <li>
              Respect for the educational goals of the course.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            In addition, we hope our PO is prepared, has a relatively clear
            idea of project objectives but is still reasonably flexible and
            welcoming for alternative approaches, ideas and solutions.
            Most of all, we ask for specific and concrete feedback throughout
            the course to ensure mutual satisfaction with the project.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you feel uncertain whether you can meet all these requirements,
            please communicate it to us if/when we meet!
          </p>
          <h1 id="members">Team members</h1>
          <p>
            We only met each other last Tuesday (Sep 29th) but we already have
            our team up, organized and going happily full speed towards our
            shared goals. Here's a brief description of each member:

                    disorganization and bloated code.

            Even if the technology you want us to apply does not show up in
            either table there's no reason to worry. We'll be happy to learn
            why you value the technology and learn to apply it. We're sure
            we will benefit from learning almost any new technology.

            In addition, we are motivated to apply the Scrum methodology as
            required by the course staff but are also interested in
            Kanban and other lightweight methodologies for continuous
            improvement.
            We aim to learn professional software development practices and
            their effective application.

            Summa summarum, we have a very strong foundation in effective
            object oriented programming languages like C++ and Python.
            We already have the necessary knowhow required for most web
            development challenges.
            Most of all, we are proven to have the ability and motivation
            to quickly learn new languages, frameworks, techniques and
            methodologies and apply them when necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are motivated to put in the necessary effort to achieve
            great results and an excellent course grade.
            In addition, our personal interests are very much inline with
            most of the project topics we are applying for which boosts
            motivation.

            Few of our members knew each other in advance. This may incur
            increased time required for team building and establishing
            effective working practices. However, it may also result in
            lower change resistance and thus faster teamwork improvement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although we have members with good levels of expertise in
            web-development we also have several with very little.
            In addition, most members have very little experience working
            in larger software projects.

            Also, it was just last weekend when most members of our team
            learned how to use the Git version control system. However, we
            learned to use it in tandem with GitHub in no time and
            <a href="http://smarisa.github.io/sdpt11/">
              this very HTML page you are reading
            </a>
            served by GitHub Pages stands as proof.

            We appreciate the time you spent checking us out and hope to meet
            you at the lecture!
