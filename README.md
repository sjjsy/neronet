# Neronet

Neronet is going to be a framework designed to facilitate the specification,
submission, monitoring, control, analysis and management of many different
computational experiments in collaboration with computing cluster resource
managers and job schedulers such as
[Slurm](https://computing.llnl.gov/linux/slurm/).

Neronet is a software development project undertaken by Team 11 of the Aalto
University course CSE-C2610 Software Project of semestern 2015-16 for Pyry
Takala from the
[Aalto deep learning research group](http://research.ics.aalto.fi/bayes/).
The project was started in October 19th 2015 and will be finished by April
11th 2016. The project is conducted in seven sprints and Scrum is employed.

This project is under the [MIT License](./LICENSE).

## Branches

The project repo contains two main branches:

- [stable](https://github.com/smarisa/neronet/tree/sprint) -- the stable state
  of the product as per the latest finished increment. It's content should be
  production ready, and it has passed our definition of done.
- [sprint](https://github.com/smarisa/neronet/tree/sprint) -- the work
  in progress of the currently ongoing increment (sprint).

Since we have only just started sprint 1 we have no product code ready in the
`stable` branch. The `sprint` branch is under active development and will be
merged to `stable` once the sprint increment is done.
