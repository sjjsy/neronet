# Neronet

Neronet is a framework designed to facilitate the specification, submission,
monitoring, control, analysis and management of many different computational
experiments. The tool is ment to be used by computational researchers that
have access to a computing cluster with several nodes accessible via SSH and
SSH keys.

Neronet is a software development project undertaken by Team 11 of the Aalto
University course CSE-C2610 Software Project of semestern 2015-16 for Pyry
Takala from the
[Aalto deep learning research group](http://research.ics.aalto.fi/bayes/).
The project was started in October 19th 2015 and will be finished by April
13th 2016. The project is conducted in seven sprints and Scrum is employed.

This project is under the [MIT License](./LICENSE).

To start using Neronet, follow the instructions at the
[Neronet start guide](./doc/start_guide.rst). A more extensive
[manual](./doc/user_manual.rst) is also available. The shortest intro
available is the briefly commented [CLI demo script](./doc/demo/script.sh).

We also have a user group at
[Google](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/neronet-users) for possible
future user community creation and user support.

## Branches

The project repo contains two main branches:

- [stable](https://github.com/smarisa/neronet/tree/sprint) -- the stable state
  of the product as per the latest finished increment. It's content should be
  production ready, and it has passed our definition of done.
- [sprint](https://github.com/smarisa/neronet/tree/sprint) -- the work
  in progress of the currently ongoing increment (sprint).

The `sprint` branch has been used for active development work and was merged
to `stable` once each sprint increment was done.
