# Neronet

Neronet is going to be a framework designed to facilitate the specification,
submission, monitoring, control, analysis and management of many different
computational experiments. It is designed to work in collaboration with
computing cluster resource managers and job schedulers such as
[Slurm](https://computing.llnl.gov/linux/slurm/).

Neronet is a software development project undertaken by Team 11 of the Aalto
University course CSE-­C2610 Software Project of semestern 2015-16 for Pyry
Takala from the
[Aalto deep learning research group](http://research.ics.aalto.fi/bayes/).

## Branches

The project repo contains two main branches:

- [stable](https://github.com/smarisa/neronet/tree/sprint) -- the stable state
  of the product as per the latest finished increment. It's content should be
  production ready, and it has passed our definition of done.
- [sprint](https://github.com/smarisa/neronet/tree/sprint) -- the work
  in progress of the currently ongoing increment (sprint).

Since we have only just started sprint 1 we have no product code ready in the
`stable` branch. The `sprint` branch is under active development and will be
merged to `stable` once the sprint increment is done.
