6.1.2016 Tested following things:

Changes to the clusters.yaml file and testing the specification of clusters.
- Changing the order of the cluster properties in clusters.yaml - the 
  program works fine
- Used 'unmanaged' as the cluster id - No errors when specifying the cluster 
  or showing the status after specifying the cluster. Yet to test whether
  or not trying to submit to this cluster works.
- Did not specify cluster type for a certain cluster - Generated key error.
  Fixed so that if the cluster type is not specified, it is initialized to 
  'unmanaged'. After that, specifying the cluster without giving type worked 
  fine.
- Did not specify port number for a certain cluster - Generates key error when
  submitting the experiment. Fixed so that the port is initialized to 22 if it 
  is not specified. After fixing, no problems occurred.
- Did not specify ssh address for a certain cluster. - Generated key error.
  Fixed so that a user friendly error message is displayed. After fixing no 
  unexpected problems.
- Made intentional grammar mistakes in the cluster attributes. - The user 
  friendly error message was shown as expected.
- Tried a cluster type that is neither 'unmanaged' or 'slurm'. - No error
  message was shown. Fixed so that an error message is displayed. No problems
  after fixing.
- Tried to use the same cluster name twice. - No errors. One of them was simply 
  removed.
- Specifying clusters via CLI works as expected.
  
Changes to the preferences.yaml file and testing status report.
- The user's information is not shown in the overall status report. - Fixed so
  that it is.
- Did not specify a default cluster. - No errors were found. The default cluster
  simply wasn't specified. Yet to test whether errors are found when trying to
  submit the experiment to default cluster.
- Made an intentional grammar mistake to the default cluster parameter. - The
  same result as above
- Did not specify an email in the preferences.yaml or email was written wrong. -
  Key error was raised. Fixed so that a user friendly error message is displayed
  instead. No problems after fixing.
- Did not specify the user's name in the preferences.yaml. - Key error was
  raised. Fixed so that a user friendly error message is displayed instead. No
  problems after fixing.
- Tried to use a default cluster that is not specified in the clusters.yaml. -
  No error message was shown to the user. Fixed so that a user friendly error
  message is shown. After fixing tested that no error message is shown if the
  default cluster field is left blank. No problems found.
